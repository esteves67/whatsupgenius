## Accounts

### Spotify
To work with the Spotify API, we have to create an application from the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login). 
Create a new application, then fill the form.
- *Name*: Whatsupgenius
- *Description*: Add some songs to a collaborative playlist on Spotify and get the lyrics on Genius thanks to a WhatsApp bot. üî• üé∂
- *Type*: Website

You are now asked if this a commercial integration, choose "*No*".
Now, copy the *Client ID* and *Client Secret*, then add them to `config/application.yml`.

**Last thing:** Click on "*Edit settings*", enter the redirect URL `http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify/callback` and click *Add*.

### Twilio
Twilio allows us to send a message to a Whatsapp number that we control with Twilio. Then, twilio will send an HTTP request, or webhook, toour application. 
We will use this to respond to incoming messages and add songs to the playlist.

Create a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
Than, add your *authentification token* to the `application.yml`.

## Setup

Get the code:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:escanxr/whatsupgenius.git
```

Set up the dependencies:
```bash
cd whatsupgenius
bundle install
```

Create a PostgreSQL role:
```sql
CREATE ROLE whatsupgenius WITH PASSWORD 'choose_a_password';
```

Config files:
* `config/application.yml`
* `config/database.yml`

You have to fill in `database.yml` _(in order to start the app)_ with the previously created login and password.

Then set up the database:
```bash
rails db:setup
```

Start the app with:
```bash
rails s
```

Then, you have to start Ngrok in another terminal tab:
```bash
path/to/ngrock http 3000
```

### Just a last thing to do

Now that Ngrok is started, copy the forwarding link (*looks like http://xxxxx.ngrok.io*).
Add the `/twilio/messages` path to it like `http://xxxxx.ngrock.io/twilio/messages`.

Go to the [Twilio Whatsapp sandbox](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/sandbox) and enter this URL to `WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN`.
Now, we'll allow our phone number to send messages to the Sandbox. Follow this link: [Twilio Whatsapp Lean](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/learn). 
Create a contact on your phone with the number given on the page and send to it the code (*something like `join xxx-list`*).

### That's all, let's go!

## How to add a music to the playlist?

On the homepage, click the '*I am ready*' button, then login with your Spotify account.
Psst, open your Spotify application: a playlist called '*What's up genius?*' has been created!

Now, you are able to manage this one with Whatsapp. Send to the Twilio contact your query.
The query is sent to Spotify and, if there's a result, Twilio returns it in the conversation.
This is the song that you wanted? Ok, so you just have to respond to 
the bot with something like `'yes', 'yeah', 'yep', 'yup' or 'üëç'`.
If it's not what you wanted, type `'no', 'nah', 'nope' or 'üëé'`.
